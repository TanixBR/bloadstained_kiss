    #bg: dark alley way#
    
    #sfx: two pairs of footsteps, overlapping#
    
    "I knew I was being followed, but I couldn’t do anything but keep walking. "
    
    "When I came to the city, I had heard whispers of streetwalkers. Vagrants that would accost or pickpocket the passerby. I knew to be careful. To always remain vigilant to and from the dosshouse. No matter how tired I really was."
    
    "Yet I turned down this alley anyway. Foolishly believing that after hours toiling away at needle and thread, I deserved a shortcut home. A simple change of pace to let me sleep even a second longer tonight. All so I can do the same thing again, tomorrow. "
    
    "My monotonous peace, however troublesome it may seem to me, could end right now if I’m not careful. "
    
    #sfx: footsteps getting faster, another increasing in speed behind it#
    
    "The back streets are easy to get lost in, yet this stranger followed me without issue. Turning where I was going to turn, almost like he was predicting my every step. Did he grow up here, too? Or was he just that persistent?"
    
    #sfx: running, its become a chase#
    
    "I didn’t care how tired I thought I felt. I could scream, but that would only slow me down. I needed to keep going. Just one more side street. One more measly step toward a front door, and this man would be committing a crime. "
    
    #VO: heavy breathing#
    
    #sfx: footsteps getting closer#
    
    "My lungs were on fire. My heart pounded in my chest."
    
    "What was once so close to me seemed impossibly far now. I wouldn’t die here. I wouldn’t end up like Papa---"
    
    #sprite: Judith_pre-meeting enters and runs to the end of the screen.#
    
    "I was such a fool. I turned the wrong way, and was stuck somewhere I didn’t recognize. I could move, but…"
    
    #sprite: Streetwalker enters, Judith is backed into the edge of the screen, trapped.#

    STREETWALKER "“‘Ello, love.”"
    
    "I hesitated to speak. I had never seen this…man before in my life. Not around the textile factory, not around the dosshouse, not even in the pub where papa used to frequent. He was a complete and total stranger. "
    
    "And that made me even more scared. "
    
    "“Right. Here’s how this about to happen, yeah? You just stand there…”"

    STREETWALKER "“Think of somewhere nice and cozy-like. Yeah? Focus on it…”"

    STREETWALKER "“Because that’s the last thing you’ll ever see, love.”"
    
    "Unlike before, now I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry out to Papa, to God, to anything that could hear me. But I couldn’t."
    
    "I couldn’t breathe at all. "
    
    #Screen goes black#
    
    RHODA "“God is a righteous judge…”"
    
    #sfx: knife slash#
    
    #Screen is normal again.#
    
    #sprite: Rhoda_hunter is standing on the opposite side of the screen. Sprite: Streetwalker visibly shakes#
    
    #sfx: sizzle#
    
    STREETWALKER "“Yeaugh!”"
    
    RHODA "“...and a God who feels indignation every day. Psalm 7:11.”"
    
    "In a flash, my fate changed forever. A woman in a scarlet jacket and a wide, white skirt had cut through the vagrant’s fingers!"
    
    STREETWALKER "“You bloody hunters…you’re all the same!”"
    
    RHODA "“And pray tell, lost soul, whatever do you mean?”"
    
    #sfx: knife slash#
    
    #sfx: sizzle#
    
    STREETWALKER "“Urgh! My hand!”"
    
    RHODA "“Do you mean our devotion to a greater power, to the safety of our fellow man?”"
    
    #sfx: knife slash#
    
    #sfx: sizzle#
    
    RHODA "“Or our calculating minds, able to stalk a creature of the night without a sound?”"
    
    #sfx: knife slash#
    
    #sfx: thud#
    
    RHODA "“Or maybe it’s something simpler than that…”"
    
    #CG of Rhoda standing before the streetwalker, now pinned against the wall just like Judith. Her knife close to his neck#
    
    #sfx: knife sharpen#
    
    RHODA "“...like finally getting what you deserve, and not realizing it until death stares at you. Right. In. The. Face.”"
    
    STREETWALKER "“Please, love. Can’t you find it in your heart to let a Whitechapel chap like me’self go?”"
    
    RHODA "“Whitechapel, you say?”"
    
    STREETWALKER "“Yes! You know it well?”"
    
    RHODA "“Yes.”"
    
    #screen goes to black#
    
    #sfx: knife slash#
    
    #VO: Scream#
    
    #sfx: sizzle#
    
    RHODA "“I’m not very fond of Whitechapel.”"
    
    #back in the alley. Rhoda_hunter stands in front of Judith_pre-meeting in the alley#
    
    "In that moment, my pursuer became ash. The moment his neck was cut, his skin turned a sickening gray as it fell to the ground in a sandy pile. This…woman somehow did this. Killed them in a way that made sure that whatever they were, they weren’t coming back. "
    
    "When she sheathed her blade, I couldn’t help but stare at her shirt. It was covered in blood, somehow left behind after the dust had settled. Yet it blended in perfectly, making it almost sparkle in what little moonlight there was."
    
    "When she turned to look at me, I felt my pulse race. That man was a monster, but I only froze up when he came closer to me. Eliminating any doubt that he would try and devour me whole. But when I looked into her eyes, I became trapped again."
    
    "It wasn’t out of fear, though that certainly was part of it. It was shock. This was a lady, her eyes as soft but cold as the noblewomen who frequent the square. And yet her eyes were stained with tears. As if this whole ordeal was painful for her."
    
    RHODA "“Are you alright?”"
    
    "And somehow, I’m able to move again. "
    
    JUDITH "“Yes! I mean, thank you madame. Truly, I cannot thank you enough.”"
    
    RHODA "“You can thank me by keeping a rosary by your side and forgetting this incident ever happened. For your own safety.”"
    
    "She started off in the opposite direction, not even a simple farewell. Just a warning and the hope I’ll understand."
    
    "But I don’t."
    
    #sfx: running#
    
    #The sprites switch sides of the screen.#
    
    JUDITH "Wait!"
    
    RHODA "I told you, it’s for your own good!"
    
    JUDITH "How can I forget what I’ve seen? Forget you? Even if I tell the world and they don’t believe me, those things might find me again!"
    
    RHODA "And that’s what the rosary is for. I suggest you keep to your place, and I’ll keep to mine. "
    
    JUDITH "My place is a dosshouse! I have no family of my own, I have no friends to my name, I am alone in this world! And my world almost ended just now, but you saved me. "
    
    RHODA "It is a service to mankind. Nothing more. "
    
    JUDITH "Then teach me that service!"
    
    RHODA "I’m sorry?"
    
    JUDITH "I can’t let someone just save my life and not give something in return! Even if it isn’t to you, I just wish to give to the world! Keep them safe like you did me. You…saved me. "
    
    "She lowered her head and let out a sigh. "
    
    RHODA "This is not work for those with something to lose. "
    
    JUDITH "All I have to lose is room and factory work. My mother passed when I was young, and my father passed only a year ago. I’m on my own. I have nothing to my name. And after almost losing my own life, I finally see something to live for. "
    
    RHODA "What? A path paved in blood? "
    
    JUDITH "And a noble lady. "
    
    "The woman was caught off-guard. Annoyed, yet intrigued. I had not known this woman for more than mere moments, yet I was determined to prove myself to her. To become her, in any way possible. "
    
    "Perhaps then, I wouldn’t end up like Papa. "
    
    RHODA "There is no turning back, girl. The only way out is the reaper."
    
    JUDITH "And when I see the reaper, I’ll be ready. "
    
    "She scoffed, then smiled. "
    
    RHODA "I am Baroness Rhoda Hawthorne. And you?"
    
    JUDITH "Judith Taylor. "
    
    RHODA "Well Miss Taylor, are you coming with me?"
    
    "And so, I never returned to the dosshouse. I never returned to that side of town again. I went straight to Lady Hawthorne’s estate, and never looked back. My life was now that of a slayer’s, and I would do anything to prove I’m worthy of Lady Hawthorne’s trust. "
    
    "Anything. "
